# Ender-3-Pro Running SKR-Mini-E3-V1.2 with BLTOUCH v3.1 connected to Servo & Probe Port, original ZMin port & Microswitch are left intact.
All Changes were made in MARLIN Bugfix 2.0 to the Configuration.h , Configuration_adv.h, and pins_BTT_SKR_MINI_E3_V1_2.h
I have uploaded these files with changes already made, as well as the compiled Firmware.Bin **please note the Probe offsets in my compiled Firmware are (-42, -16, -0.700) <--- (X , Y , Z) ***
